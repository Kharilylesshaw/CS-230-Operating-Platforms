# System Analysis & Design of "Draw It or Lose It" for a client of Creative Technology Solutions

## Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements

The Gaming Room, a client of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), requested the development of a web-based version of their popular game, "Draw It or Lose It." This game is inspired by the 1980s television show "Win, Lose or Draw" and requires teams to compete by guessing clues from drawn images. The software needed to support real-time interaction, scalability for a large user base, and cross-platform compatibility across web and mobile environments. Additionally, the system had to ensure secure access, reliable performance, and efficient management of game sessions, players, and teams.

## Strengths in Developing the Documentation

One of the strengths in developing the software design document was the ability to clearly organize the client’s requirements into actionable sections, ensuring that all aspects of the system’s architecture, functionality, and constraints were addressed. The use of diagrams, such as UML class and activity diagrams, helped visualize the relationships between system components and the user workflows, making the design accessible to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders. This structured approach ensured alignment with the client’s goals and clarified the implementation plan.

## Insights from the Design Document Process

Working through the design document highlighted the importance of identifying potential challenges early in the process, such as ensuring real-time synchronization across distributed environments. This foresight proved valuable when transitioning to coding, as it provided a clear roadmap and reduced uncertainties during development. The process also emphasized the value of balancing technical details with user-friendly language, making it easier to communicate the design to all involved parties.

## Areas for Improvement

If I were to revise one aspect of the documentation, it would be the technical recommendations section. Including more specific examples of tools, such as containerization platforms like Docker or orchestration tools like Kubernetes, would strengthen the case for scalability and reliability. Additionally, elaborating on potential cost implications of different architectural choices could provide the client with a more comprehensive view of the long-term feasibility of the design.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

Interpreting user needs was central to the design process. By analyzing the requirements for real-time gameplay, scalability, and ease of use, the design incorporated features like a cloud-based storage system, RESTful APIs, and microservices architecture. These choices ensured that the system met performance expectations and provided a seamless user experience. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the system remains functional, practical, and aligned with the client’s vision, ultimately fostering trust and satisfaction.

## Approach to Software Design

The software design process relied on a modular approach, breaking the system into manageable components such as user management, game session handling, and security. This approach made it easier to design, test, and integrate each part while maintaining a cohesive overall system. In future projects, I would continue to employ techniques like user story mapping and iterative feedback loops to refine the design further. Using tools such as wireframes and prototypes earlier in the process would also help ensure that the final system aligns closely with client expectations and user needs.
