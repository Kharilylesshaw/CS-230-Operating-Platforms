# Analysis & Design of "Draw It or Lose It" for The Gaming Room" Client

## Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements

The Gaming Room, a client of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), requested the development of a web-based version of their popular game, "Draw It or Lose It." This game is inspired by the 1980s television game show "Win, Lose or Draw," where teams compete to guess what is being drawn before time runs out. For the web-based version, the game must render images from a stock library of clues and allow players to participate in real time across multiple platforms.

## Reflection on the Documentation Process

One aspect of the documentation process I excelled at was organizing the client’s requirements into clear, actionable components. By identifying their technical and business needs early on, I could design a solution that aligned with their goals. The use of diagrams and structured sections helped me ensure the design was both comprehensive and accessible.

Working through the design document was particularly helpful for understanding the system’s architecture before writing any code. It allowed me to identify potential challenges, such as implementing cross-platform compatibility or ensuring scalability, and address them proactively. This process provided a roadmap that made coding more structured and efficient.

If I were to revise one part of the documentation, it would be the evaluation of operating platforms. While my analysis was thorough, I could improve it by including more specific examples of tools and frameworks that would support the client’s needs. For instance, discussing containerization tools like Docker or orchestration platforms like Kubernetes could add depth to the recommendations.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

To interpret the user’s needs, I analyzed their requirements for real-time interaction, scalability, and cross-platform functionality. These needs were then integrated into the design by recommending a Linux-based operating platform with microservices architecture and cloud storage. User-centric design principles ensured the system was accessible, secure, and able to handle multiple concurrent sessions.

Considering user needs is critical when designing software because it directly impacts usability and user satisfaction. A well-designed system that meets the client’s expectations fosters trust and ensures long-term success for both the client and their users.

## Approach to Software Design

In designing the software, I adopted a modular approach, breaking the system into manageable components like storage, memory management, and security. By addressing each part separately, I ensured that the overall design was cohesive and adaptable. In the future, I would continue to use techniques like user flow diagrams and wireframes to visualize the system early in the process. Additionally, incorporating more iterative feedback loops with the client could help refine the design and better align it with their evolving needs.
